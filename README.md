This is the first Object Oriented project, written in Python, that I started in september 2019 and finished in june 2020
(dates on the file vary for coping into backup) and its a simple text andventure game in the style of 
games like Zork and was done as part of extention work for my A-level. The code given to us was the attack 
method which was to just start us off on the project.

the python file "curits the dog" was the initial completed work for class, and "curtis the dogv2" was an improvement
of that initial file in my own time.
